### Overview

Complete migration from custom authentication/database/realtime system to native
Supabase stack. This foundational change will eliminate complex custom
implementations, resolve ongoing realtime issues, and provide a more
maintainable, scalable platform for future development.

### Migration Rationale

**Current System Issues:**

- Complex custom SSE realtime implementation with authentication and connection
  management issues
- 8/8 realtime E2E tests failing due to SSE connection establishment problems
- Manual JWT authentication system requiring custom middleware
- Custom database connection and transaction management
- Difficult to test and maintain custom realtime infrastructure

**Supabase Benefits:**

- **Proven Realtime**: Battle-tested websocket infrastructure used by thousands
  of apps
- **Integrated Auth**: Built-in JWT authentication with session management
- **Database Triggers**: Automatic realtime updates without manual event
  emission
- **Better Testing**: Superior tooling for mocking and testing realtime
  connections
- **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminates ~500+ lines of custom infrastructure
  code

      context vs user_profiles table
    - **Solution #1**: Temporarily disabled RLS on families table
      (migration 010) for development
    - **Root Cause #2**: Next.js router navigation conflicts during rapid auth
      state changes in createFamily flow
    - **Issue #2**: `router.push()` calls not working due to auth context

## üß™ E2E Test Suite Fixes

### ‚úÖ Recently Completed (2025-09-27)

- [x] **Environment Setup** - Supabase local environment running, development
      server started

### ‚úÖ E2E Test Fixing Progress (2025-09-27)

- [x] **Run initial test scan** - Assessed all current test failures
- [x] **Fix character-creation.spec.ts** - Fixed 3 tests for character creation
      flow (3/3 passing)
- [x] **Fix quest-system.spec.ts** - Fixed 4 tests for quest management (4/4
      passing)
- [x] **Fix reward-store.spec.ts** - Fixed 4 tests for reward store
      functionality (4/4 passing)
- [x] **Identify core issue: Field name mismatch** - Found Prisma types
      (camelCase) vs Supabase data (snake_case) mismatch
- [x] **Add quest action button data-testids** - Added data-testid attributes
      for reliable E2E testing
- [x] **Fix quest pickup functionality** - Fixed field name references
      (assigned_to_id vs assignedToId)
- [x] **quest-completion-rewards.spec.ts partially fixed** - Quest pickup and
      status transitions working, approval workflow needs type migration

### üîÑ Current E2E Test Status

- **11/22 tests passing** (50% success rate)
- **Main blocker identified**: Hybrid Prisma/Supabase type system causing
  runtime mismatches
- **Solution needed**: Complete migration to native Supabase types

### üéØ **NEXT PRIORITY: Complete Supabase Type Migration**

**Root Cause**: Currently using Prisma types (camelCase fields) while fetching
Supabase data (snake_case fields), causing UI component filtering and
conditional logic failures.

**Impact**: Quest approval buttons not appearing, realtime subscriptions not
working properly, data filtering logic broken.

**Solution**: Migrate all components from `@/lib/generated/prisma` types to
native Supabase types from `@/lib/types/database`.

---

## üîÑ **Supabase Type Migration Tasks**

  - **Result**: WebSocket 403 errors resolved, realtime authentication working
    in development
- ‚úÖ **Fixed syntax error** - Removed extra closing parentheses in
  realtime-context.tsx causing compilation errors

- [x] Invalid family code validation confirmed working

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED (2025-09-28) - Session 5**

      non-JWT token (`sb_publishable_*`) causing "Expected 3 parts in JWT; got
      1" errors
- [x] **Generated proper JWT anon token** - Used default Supabase local secret
      to create valid JWT token starting with `eyJh`
- [x] **Updated .env file** - Replaced invalid key with proper JWT:
      `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
- [x] **Family joining now works** - Users can successfully join families with
      valid codes like "9R7BIW"
