echo "🔧 Key Fix Verification:"
echo "✅ Character creation page now uses useCharacter hook"
echo "✅ handleCharacterCreated calls refreshCharacter() before redirect"
echo "✅ Character context properly manages state with useCallback"
echo "✅ Build completes without linting errors"

echo "🎯 Expected Behavior:"
echo "- After creating character, refreshCharacter() is called"
echo "- Character context gets updated with new character data"
echo "- Dashboard loads with character data available"
echo "- No redirect loop occurs"

echo "✅ Character creation redirect fix is ready for manual testing"
