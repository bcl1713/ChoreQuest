## üîÑ Core Game Loop

### Primary Loop (Daily)

1. **Morning Briefing**: Check guild board for new quests and active boss
   battles
2. **Quest Selection**: Choose daily/weekly tasks appropriate to character level
   and class
3. **Task Execution**: Complete real-world chores with optional bonus objectives
4. **Progress Reporting**: Mark quests complete, take photos for verification if
   needed
5. **Reward Collection**: Receive XP and gold after parent/system approval
6. **Character Growth**: Spend currency, level up, unlock new abilities and
   cosmetics

### Secondary Loop (Weekly/Monthly)

1. **Boss Battle Participation**: Join family in taking down major household
   projects
2. **Seasonal Events**: Participate in limited-time themed content
3. **Leaderboard Competition**: Compete for monthly recognition and bragging
   rights
4. **Reward Redemption**: Exchange earned currency for real-world privileges and
   items
5. **Family Celebration**: Acknowledge achievements and plan future challenges

### Recurring Quest Mechanics (2025 Update)

- **Quest Templates**: Guild Masters define daily or weekly quest blueprints with loot tables, class bonuses, and optional hero assignments.
- **Family Claim Flow**: Family quests spawn in an `AVAILABLE` state. Heroes can volunteer to claim one at a time, gaining a 20% volunteer reward bonus if they convert it to `CLAIMED`.
- **Streaks & Momentum**: Completing recurring quests consecutively increases streak counters. Every 5-day streak unlocks an extra 1% reward bonus (capped at 5%).

### Leveling & Progression System

**üìà Experience Point & Reward Calculation**

The total XP required to reach a certain level is governed by the formula:
`Total XP for Level = 50 * (level - 1) ** 2`

This creates a smooth progression curve that makes early levels fast and
higher levels increasingly challenging. Final rewards for any given quest are also
affected by two key multipliers:

- **Difficulty Multiplier**: Quests can be set to Easy (1.0x rewards),
  Medium (1.5x rewards), or Hard (2.0x rewards).
- **Class Bonus**: Each character class has a permanent bonus to earning
  specific types of rewards (see Class Selection below).

**üéÅ Level Unlock Rewards**

Leveling up is a measure of a player's seniority, trust, and status within the
family guild. It grants access to new privileges and powers, not new chores.

- **Status & Recognition**:
  - **Every Level**: Receive a small Gold bonus.
  - **Major Milestones**: Earn new, more prestigious titles displayed under your
    character name (e.g., "Recruit" -> "Iron Adventurer" -> "Silver Champion").

  - **Level 10**: Unlock a "Cape" slot for your avatar.
  - **Level 20**: Unlock a "Pet" slot for a companion that follows your avatar.

  - **Level 20**: Unlock the ability to propose new quests for the family (GM
    approval required).
  - **Level 40**: Unlock the ability to help design a family "Boss Battle."

**üé≠ Class Ability Unlock Schedule**

Class abilities are unlocked and upgraded at specific level milestones.

- **Level 5**: Unlock the Core Ability for your chosen class (e.g., `Vow of
  Excellence I` for Knight, `Swift Strike I` for Rogue).
- **Level 15**: Upgrade the Core Ability to its second stage (e.g., `Vow of
  Excellence II`), making it more effective or flexible.
- **Level 30**: Unlock the powerful "Ultimate" ability for your class (e.g.,

## üìù Conclusion

ChoreQuest represents a revolutionary approach to family household management by
transforming mundane chores into an engaging, collaborative adventure. By
combining proven game mechanics with thoughtful family dynamics, the system
creates sustainable motivation for household responsibility while strengthening
family bonds.

The key to ChoreQuest's success lies in its balance between individual
achievement and family cooperation. Unlike traditional chore charts that can
create resentment or competition, this system encourages both personal growth
and collective success through carefully designed mechanics that ensure everyone
can contribute meaningfully to the family's shared goals.

By implementing this system in phases, families can gradually adopt the more
complex features while immediately benefiting from the core motivation and
tracking capabilities. The mobile-first design ensures accessibility across all
family members, while the smart home integration provides future-proofing for
evolving household technology.

Most importantly, ChoreQuest transforms the fundamental relationship between
family members and household responsibilities from obligation-based to
adventure-based, creating positive associations that can last a lifetime.
