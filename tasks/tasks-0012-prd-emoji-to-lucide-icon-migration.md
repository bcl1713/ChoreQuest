## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Phase 1: Migrate Dashboard & Character System
  - [x] 1.1 Update `lib/constants/character-classes.ts` to replace emoji icon strings with Lucide icon name references (e.g., `icon: "Wand"` instead of `icon: "üîÆ"`). Document that consumers will need to import the actual icon component.
  - [x] 1.2 Update `components/character/CharacterCreation.tsx` to import Lucide icons (Wand, Sword, Shield, Sparkles, Crosshair) and render them instead of emoji strings from character class data. Apply size 24px for class selection icons with aria-labels.

  - [x] 1.4 Review `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - verify existing Lucide icon usage (Sword, Store) is consistent. Replace any remaining emoji with Lucide icons. Ensure tab icons are 20px with proper aria-labels.
  - [x] 1.5 Update test file `tests/unit/components/character-creation.test.tsx` to expect Lucide icon components instead of emoji strings. Use `getByLabelText` or check for icon data attributes.

  - [ ] 6.2 Update `PLANNING.md` to replace emoji with text references. No actual Lucide components can be rendered in markdown, so use descriptive text (e.g., "‚úÖ Complete" becomes "Complete ‚úì" or "[‚úì] Complete").
  - [ ] 6.3 Update `README.md` to replace emoji with text or unicode equivalents that are more widely supported. Focus on clarity over decoration.
  - [ ] 6.4 Update all markdown files in `docs/` directory to replace emoji with text references. Review `docs/202508291550-Technical-Design-Document.md` and `docs/202508291552-Game-Design-Document.md` specifically.

  - [ ] 6.6 Keep `tasks/emoji-to-lucide-icon-mapping.md` as-is for reference. This document should maintain its emoji for mapping purposes.
  - [ ] 6.7 Create or update developer documentation with icon usage guidelines: when to use which Lucide icon, sizing standards, accessibility requirements (aria-labels vs aria-hidden).

- [ ] 7.0 Final Quality Assurance & Cleanup
  - [ ] 7.1 Run comprehensive visual QA - manually test all screens in browser to verify icons display correctly: Dashboard, Quests (card, creation, stats), Rewards (store, redemption), Admin (dashboard, activity feed, statistics), Character creation, Landing page.
  - [ ] 7.2 Verify responsive design - check icon display at mobile (320px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1024px+) breakpoints. Ensure icons don't overflow or break layout.
  - [ ] 7.3 Perform accessibility audit - verify all meaningful icons have aria-labels, decorative icons are aria-hidden. Use browser dev tools or axe DevTools to check.
  - [ ] 7.4 Run full test suite: `npm run test` - all tests must pass. Fix any remaining test failures.
  - [ ] 7.5 Run build verification: `npm run build` - must complete with zero errors.
  - [ ] 7.6 Run lint verification: `npm run lint` - must pass with zero warnings.
  - [ ] 7.7 Perform manual regression testing checklist:
    - [ ] Character creation displays class icons correctly
    - [ ] Quest cards show XP/gold/streak icons properly
    - [ ] Reward store displays reward/gem/coin icons
    - [ ] Admin dashboard tabs render correctly
    - [ ] Activity feed events have appropriate icons
    - [ ] All buttons and actions have proper icons
  - [ ] 7.8 Review all changed files for consistency - verify icon sizing, spacing, and color usage follows established patterns.
  - [ ] 7.9 Search codebase for any remaining emoji: `grep -r "[üéÅüí∞üíéü™ô‚≠ê‚ö°‚úÖ‚ùå‚è≥‚ö†Ô∏è‚úèÔ∏èüóëÔ∏èüéØüõ°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏èüèÜüëëüî•üéñÔ∏è‚ú®üîÆüèπ‚ÑπÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏èüìäüìàüìùüè∑Ô∏èüìúüè∞‚öîÔ∏èüöÄüîßüéâüé™]" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --exclude-dir=node_modules`. Verify any findings are intentional (user content fields, example data, etc.).
  - [ ] 7.10 Update TASKS.md with completion notes and any lessons learned for future icon migrations.
