### Existing Files to Modify

### Notes
- Unit tests should be placed in `tests/unit/` mirroring the source file structure

- Follow existing patterns from `QuestTemplateManager` and `RewardManager` for component structure
- Leverage existing `useAuth()` hook for role-based access control
- Use `@headlessui/react` Tab components for accessible tabbed interface
