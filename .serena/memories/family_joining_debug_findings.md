# Family Joining Debug Findings

## Problem
All family codes are being rejected, even valid ones that exist in the database.

## Evidence
1. Family code "A0GX31" exists in database (confirmed via direct query)
2. Invalid family code test passes (correctly rejects invalid codes)
3. Valid family code test shows "Invalid family code" error in UI
4. RLS policy was disabled but issue persists

## Root Cause Analysis
- Issue is NOT with RLS policies (disabling RLS didn't fix it)
- Issue is NOT with database data (family codes exist)
- Issue appears to be in application-level family code validation
- Supabase client is getting JWT authentication errors when trying to lookup families

## Next Steps
1. Check application authentication context setup
2. Check environment variables for Supabase client
3. Debug the actual family lookup query being executed
4. Test with proper authentication flow
