# E2E Test Fixes Session - September 26, 2025

## Session Summary
Successfully resolved major authentication and navigation blockers preventing realtime sync E2E tests from running. Fixed both realtime-sync.spec.ts and realtime-flow.test.ts test suites.

## Major Fixes Completed

### 1. setupTestUser Function Issues
**Problem**: Function wasn't returning token property that tests needed
**Files**: `/tests/e2e/helpers/setup-helpers.ts`
**Solution**: 
- Updated function signature: `Promise<{ user: TestUserInfo; token: string }>`
- Added token extraction: `const token = authData.token || '';`
- Updated both return statements to include token

### 2. Multi-Tab Authentication Sharing
**Problem**: Flawed localStorage sharing logic between browser contexts
**Files**: `/tests/e2e/realtime-sync.spec.ts`
**Solution**: 
- Fixed destructuring: `const { token, user } = await setupTestUser(page1);`
- Proper data passing: `await page2.evaluate(({ authToken, userData }) => { ... }, { authToken: token, userData: user });`

### 3. Navigation Logic
**Problem**: Tests expected automatic redirect to dashboard, but app requires manual navigation
**Files**: `/tests/e2e/realtime-sync.spec.ts`
**Solution**: Added manual navigation after auth setup:
```javascript
await page2.getByText('üè∞ Enter Your Realm').click();
```

### 4. Test Selector Issues  
**Problem**: Wrong data-testid and expected text values
**Files**: `/tests/e2e/realtime-sync.spec.ts`
**Solution**:
- Changed `realtime-connection-status` ‚Üí `realtime-status`
- Changed expected text `'connected'` ‚Üí `'Live Updates'`

### 5. Async/Await Issues in realtime-flow.test.ts
**Problem**: `await` in non-async functions and async/done callback conflicts
**Files**: `/tests/integration/realtime-flow.test.ts`
**Solution**:
- Made functions async: `async (done)` ‚Üí `async ()`
- Removed `done()` calls since async functions return promises

## Current Test Status

### ‚úÖ realtime-flow.test.ts: ALL 7 TESTS PASSING
```
‚úì should complete full flow for quest status change
‚úì should complete full flow for character stats change  
‚úì should handle multiple database changes with proper event sequencing
‚úì should deliver events to multiple clients in same family
‚úì should not deliver events to clients from different families
‚úì should handle client disconnection gracefully
‚úì should handle database errors during event emission gracefully
```

### üîÑ realtime-sync.spec.ts: MAJOR PROGRESS - Authentication Fixed
- **Before**: All 8 tests failing at authentication (page2 stuck on homepage)
- **After**: All 8 tests pass authentication and reach dashboard successfully
- **Current Issue**: SSE connection establishment - showing "Disconnected" instead of "Live Updates"

## Next Session Focus: SSE Connection Issues

The remaining blocker is Server-Sent Events (SSE) connection establishment during tests. All authentication and navigation issues are resolved.

### Investigation Areas for Next Session:
1. **SSE Endpoint Debugging**: `/app/api/events/route.ts` - may not be handling test requests properly
2. **Real-time Context in Tests**: `RealTimeProvider` may not establish connections during Playwright tests  
3. **Test Timing**: SSE connections may need more time or different setup approach
4. **JWT Authentication for SSE**: Ensure tokens are properly passed to SSE endpoint

### Key Files to Check Next Session:
- `/app/api/events/route.ts` - SSE endpoint implementation
- `/lib/realtime-context.tsx` - Real-time connection logic
- `/components/quest-dashboard.tsx` - Connection status display
- `/tests/e2e/realtime-sync.spec.ts` - Add SSE connection debugging

### Development Environment Setup:
- Docker containers: ‚úÖ Running (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Dev server: ‚úÖ Running on localhost:3000
- All quality gates passing except realtime sync E2E tests

## Session Achievements
- Fixed all authentication/navigation blockers
- Got realtime-flow.test.ts to 100% pass rate
- Realtime sync tests now reach dashboard successfully
- Clear path forward for SSE connection debugging
