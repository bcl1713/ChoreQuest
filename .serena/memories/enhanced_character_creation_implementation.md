## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Character Class Configuration System
**File**: `lib/constants/character-classes.ts`

- **CharacterClassInfo Interface**: Type-safe character class metadata
- **CHARACTER_CLASSES Array**: All 5 classes with accurate bonus values
  - MAGE: +20% XP on all quests
  - ROGUE: +15% Gold on all quests
  - KNIGHT: +5% XP, +5% Gold on all quests
  - HEALER: +10% XP, +25% Honor on all quests
  - RANGER: +30% Gems on all quests

- **Helper Functions**:
  - `formatBonusPercentage(multiplier)`: Converts multipliers to percentage display (e.g., 1.2 → "+20%")
  - `getCharacterClassInfo(classId)`: Lookup function for class metadata

**Critical Design Decision**: Bonus values MUST match `RewardCalculator.getClassBonus()` exactly. This is enforced by unit tests to prevent inconsistencies.

**Tests**: 24 unit tests in `lib/constants/character-classes.test.ts` verify:
- All 5 classes defined
- Bonus multipliers match RewardCalculator exactly
- All required fields present (name, description, icon, bonuses)

### 2. Character Name Pre-fill Flow
Eliminates duplicate name entry by storing name from registration/family creation and pre-filling in character creation.

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/auth-context.tsx`: Added `characterName` state and `setCharacterName()` method
- `app/auth/create-family/page.tsx`: Stores `userName` after successful family creation
- `app/auth/register/page.tsx`: Stores `name` after successful registration
- `components/character/CharacterCreation.tsx`: Accepts `initialCharacterName` prop
- `app/character/create/page.tsx`: Passes `characterName` from context to component

**Flow**:
1. User enters name in family creation or registration form
2. After successful auth, name stored in auth context via `setCharacterName()`
3. Navigation to character creation page
4. CharacterCreation component receives name via `initialCharacterName` prop
5. Name field pre-filled but remains editable and validated

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Name is optional prop with empty string default
- Pre-filled name still requires validation (can't be empty on submit)
- User can edit pre-filled name before submitting
- Works for both family creation and family joining flows

### 3. Class Bonus Display UI
**File**: `components/character/CharacterCreation.tsx`

Replaced hardcoded class data with `CHARACTER_CLASSES` configuration and added accurate bonus display.

**Bonus Display Logic**:
- Only show bonuses where multiplier > 1.0
- Uses `formatBonusPercentage()` for clean percentage display
- Icons for each bonus type:
  - ⚡ XP (primary-400 color)
  - 💰 Gold (gold-400 color)
  - 🎖️ Honor (purple-400 color)
  - 💎 Gems (gem-400 color)
- Shows "Bonuses on ALL quests:" header to clarify global bonus application

**Example Display for MAGE**:
```
🔮 Mage
Masters of arcane knowledge and wisdom

Bonuses on ALL quests:
⚡ +20% XP
```

**Example Display for KNIGHT**:
```
🛡️ Knight
Balanced warriors of honor

Bonuses on ALL quests:
⚡ +5% XP
💰 +5% Gold
```

### 4. Mobile-Responsive Layout
**Implementation**: Responsive Tailwind CSS classes

**Desktop (md breakpoint and above)**:
- Grid layout: 2 columns (md), 3 columns (lg)
- Standard grid spacing with gap-4
- Cards remain in viewport

**Mobile (< md breakpoint)**:
- Horizontal scrollable flex container
- CSS scroll-snap enabled: `snap-x snap-mandatory`
- Each card: `min-w-[280px]` with `snap-center`
- Cards swipeable with touch gestures
- Bottom padding for scroll indicators
- Negative margin to allow edge-to-edge scroll

**Key CSS Classes**:
```
Container: "md:grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 md:gap-4 flex md:flex-none overflow-x-auto md:overflow-x-visible snap-x snap-mandatory gap-4 pb-4 md:pb-0 -mx-2 px-2 md:mx-0 md:px-0"

Cards: "min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0 snap-center flex-shrink-0 md:flex-shrink"
```

## E2E Test Updates
**Files Modified**:
- `tests/e2e/character-creation.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/family-joining.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/helpers/setup-helpers.ts`

**New Test Cases Added**:
1. "character name pre-fills from family creation and is editable"
2. "character name pre-fills from family join and is editable"
3. "class bonus information displays correctly"
4. "class selection is scrollable on mobile viewport"

**Test Updates**:
- Updated helpers to handle pre-filled name in character creation
- All existing character creation tests updated to expect pre-filled names
- Family joining tests updated for new flow
- Mobile viewport tests verify scrollable class selection

## Quality Gates
All quality gates passed:
- ✅ `npm run build`: Zero compilation errors
- ✅ `npm run lint`: Zero linting errors/warnings
- ✅ `npx jest`: 99/99 unit tests passing
- ✅ `npx playwright test`: All E2E tests passing

## Files Modified Summary

### New Files Created
- `lib/constants/character-classes.ts`: Character class configuration
- `lib/constants/character-classes.test.ts`: Unit tests for configuration

### Modified Files
- `lib/auth-context.tsx`: Added characterName state management
- `app/auth/create-family/page.tsx`: Store character name on success
- `app/auth/register/page.tsx`: Store character name on success
- `components/character/CharacterCreation.tsx`: Accept pre-filled name, display accurate bonuses, mobile-responsive layout
- `app/character/create/page.tsx`: Pass characterName from context
- `tests/e2e/character-creation.spec.ts`: Updated and new tests
- `tests/e2e/family-joining.spec.ts`: Updated for pre-fill flow
- `tests/e2e/helpers/setup-helpers.ts`: Helper adjustments

## Architecture Patterns

### Single Source of Truth
Bonus values defined once in `CHARACTER_CLASSES` and imported everywhere needed. Unit tests enforce consistency with `RewardCalculator`.

### Progressive Enhancement
Name pre-fill enhances UX but doesn't break if name is missing (optional prop with default).

### Mobile-First Design
Layout starts with mobile horizontal scroll, progressively enhances to grid on larger screens using Tailwind breakpoints.

### Type Safety
TypeScript interfaces ensure type-safe class configuration throughout the application.

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Add scroll indicators (dots) showing position in mobile card carousel
- Consider adding class recommendation based on family quest patterns
- Add tooltips with more detailed class information
- Consider animated transitions between class selections

### Maintenance Notes
- When adding new character classes, update `CHARACTER_CLASSES` in constants
- When changing bonus values, update both `RewardCalculator.getClassBonus()` and `CHARACTER_CLASSES`
- Unit tests will catch any discrepancies between the two
- Mobile layout assumes 280px minimum card width - adjust if class card content increases

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests verify data consistency (bonuses match RewardCalculator)
- E2E tests verify complete user flow (family creation → character creation with pre-fill)
- E2E tests verify mobile responsiveness (scrollable cards, viewport tests)
- All tests must pass before merging
