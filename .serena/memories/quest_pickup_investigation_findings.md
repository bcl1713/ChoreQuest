# Quest Pickup Investigation Findings (2025-09-28)

## Key Discoveries

### E2E Test Issues Fixed
- **Create Quest Button**: Fixed test selector from `button:text("‚ö° Create Quest")` to `[data-testid="create-quest-button"]`
- **Responsive Design**: Button text changes based on screen size (sm+ shows "‚ö° Create Quest", smaller shows "‚ö° Quest")

### Confirmed Quest Pickup Issue
- **Problem**: Quest pickup functionality is not working properly
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Quests are created successfully 
  - Quest pickup button exists and is clickable
  - After pickup, quest does NOT move from "Available Quests" to "My Quests" section
  - Test expects quest to appear in "My Quests" but it doesn't

### Technical Analysis
- **handlePickupQuest function exists** in quest-dashboard.tsx (lines 295-318)
- **Function logic looks correct**: Updates assigned_to_id and status to 'IN_PROGRESS'
- **Realtime updates**: Should handle UI updates automatically via realtime subscriptions
- **WebSocket 403 errors**: Realtime connection failures might prevent UI updates

### Root Cause Hypothesis
The quest pickup is likely failing at the database level due to:
1. RLS policies blocking the update operation
2. Missing permissions for user to assign quests to themselves  
3. Realtime subscriptions not working due to WebSocket 403 errors preventing UI refresh

### Next Steps
1. Investigate RLS policies for quest_instances table updates
2. Test quest pickup functionality manually to confirm database changes
3. Check if realtime subscription failures are blocking UI updates
4. Consider adding error handling/logging to quest pickup function
