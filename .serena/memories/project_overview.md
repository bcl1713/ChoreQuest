# ChoreQuest Project Overview

ChoreQuest is a fantasy RPG-themed family chore management system that transforms household tasks into epic adventures. Built with modern web technologies, it's designed for families who want to gamify their daily routines.

## Vision Statement
ChoreQuest transforms household chores into an epic fantasy RPG adventure where family members become heroes completing quests (chores) to gain experience, collect treasure, and defeat powerful bosses threatening their realm (home). The system balances healthy competition between siblings with cooperative family challenges, using positive reinforcement and catch-up mechanics to ensure everyone stays engaged.
