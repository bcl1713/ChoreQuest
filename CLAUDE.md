# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

IMPORTANT: Always read PLANNING.md at the start of every new conversation, check
TASKS.md before starting your work, mark completed tasks to TASKS.md
immediately, and add newly discovered tasks to TASKS.md as soon as they are
found.

IMPORTANT: You should never make edits to the main branch directly. Always
create a feature branch for any changes, no matter how small.

## ChoreQuest Project Overview

ChoreQuest is a fantasy RPG-themed family chore management system designed to
gamify household tasks. The system transforms daily chores into epic quests
where family members become heroes earning XP, gold, and rewards through
real-world task completion.

## High-Level Architecture

This is a **planned full-stack web application** with the following intended
architecture based on the design documents:

### Frontend

- **React 18 + Next.js 15**: Server-side rendering with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- **Tailwind CSS**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Framer Motion**: Animations and visual feedback
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable mobile experience

### Backend

- **Node.js/Express**: RESTful API server
- **PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM**: Primary database with type-safe operations
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **Socket.io**: Real-time features (family activity, boss battles)
- **JWT Authentication**: Role-based access control

### Infrastructure

- **Docker Compose**: Containerized development and deployment
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy and static file serving
- **Automated backups**: PostgreSQL backup strategy

## Core Game Concepts

### Character System

- **Classes**: Knight, Mage, Ranger, Rogue, Healer (each with specialization
  bonuses)
- **Progression**: XP-based leveling with unlockable abilities
- **Avatars**: Customizable fantasy characters with equipment display

### Quest System

- **Daily Quests**: Routine household tasks (make bed, brush teeth, etc.)
- **Weekly Quests**: Larger projects (deep cleaning, yard work)
- **Boss Battles**: Collaborative family challenges with persistent HP
- **Bonus Objectives**: Optional extra challenges for additional rewards

### Economy

- **Gold**: Primary currency from quest completion
- **Gems**: Premium currency from boss battles and achievements
- **Honor Points**: Social currency from helping family members
- **Real-world Rewards**: Screen time, privileges, purchases, experiences

### Family Dynamics

- **Dual Leaderboards**: Individual achievement + family cooperation
- **SOS System**: Help requests between family members
- **Catch-up Mechanics**: Automatic balancing to prevent discouragement
- **Real-time Activity**: Live family quest completion feed

## Project Status

**Current State**: Early development phase

- Core authentication system implemented (JWT, family/user management)
- Character creation and basic dashboard functionality complete
- Database schema established with Prisma ORM
- Test infrastructure configured (Playwright E2E, Jest unit tests)

- **Boss Battles** ‚Üê **Boss Participants** (many-to-many collaboration)
- **Achievements** ‚Üê **User Achievements** (progress tracking)
- **Transactions** (comprehensive economy tracking)

## Testing Strategy

**TDD Requirements**:

- Write failing tests before any production code
- Maintain 80%+ code coverage across all layers
- Unit tests (70%), Integration tests (25%), E2E tests (5%)

**Test Categories**:

- API endpoints with authentication
- Database operations and transactions
- Real-time Socket.io events
- React component behavior
- Complete user workflows

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based permissions (Guild Master, Hero, Young Hero)
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Family-scoped data isolation
- No cross-family data leakage

## Integration Points

### Home Assistant (Future)

- REST API endpoints for family metrics
- WebSocket events for real-time updates
- Webhook support for external triggers
- Automated quest creation from sensor data

### Smart Home Potential

- IoT sensor integration
- Voice assistant support
- Calendar synchronization
- Automatic task completion detection

## Development Notes

- **Mobile-first design**: All interfaces must work on phones/tablets
- **Family-focused**: Multi-user experience within single household
- **Real-time collaboration**: Socket.io for live family interactions
- **Positive reinforcement**: Game mechanics designed to encourage, not punish
- **Scalable architecture**: Docker-based deployment ready for growth

## Implementation Priority

1. **Start with Phase 1 MVP** - establish core functionality
2. **Focus on mobile experience** - primary interaction method
3. **Implement TDD rigorously** - quality foundation critical
4. **Design for real-time** - family collaboration is key differentiator
5. **Plan for Home Assistant integration** - technical differentiator

When implementing features, always consider:

- How does this strengthen family bonds?
- Is this accessible to younger users?
- Does this create positive motivation?
- Can this scale to different family sizes?
- How does this integrate with the fantasy theme?
- Always create a branch for new features and commit often. When a feature is
  complete create a PR and merge to main

## üö® MANDATORY Test-Driven Development Workflow üö®

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: STRICT TDD PROCESS - NO EXCEPTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Every change follows this exact sequence. No shortcuts, no "simplified testing",
no workarounds.

### üõë **STOP: BRANCH CHECK REQUIRED BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES** üõë

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY PRE-WORK VERIFICATION ‚ö†Ô∏è**

Before touching ANY code, run these commands and follow the checklist:

```bash
# 1. Check current branch status
git branch

# 2. Verify you are NOT on main
# If on main, IMMEDIATELY create feature branch
```

**MANDATORY CHECKLIST - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

- [ ] ‚úÖ Verified current branch with `git branch`
- [ ] ‚úÖ If on main: Created feature branch with
      `git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name`
- [ ] ‚úÖ Branch name follows format: `feature/descriptive-kebab-case-name`
- [ ] ‚úÖ Ready to start TDD process

**üö® ABSOLUTE RULE: ZERO CODE CHANGES ON MAIN BRANCH üö®**

- If you are on main and about to make changes, STOP immediately
- Create a feature branch first, no matter how small the change
- This applies to: bug fixes, features, refactoring, documentation, EVERYTHING

### ‚úÖ MANDATORY TDD Process (STRICT ORDER)

#### 1. **Identify & Branch** üéØ

```bash
# MANDATORY: Always verify branch status first
git branch

# If on main, create feature branch immediately
git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

**Required branch naming conventions:**

- `feature/quest-system-implementation`
- `feature/character-stats-display`
- `bugfix/dashboard-refresh-issue`
- `refactor/component-structure-cleanup`

#### 2. **Write Tests FIRST** üß™

- Write failing tests for the functionality you want to implement
- Tests MUST be comprehensive - happy path, edge cases, error conditions
- Fix any test infrastructure issues (never skip broken tests)
- Run tests: `npm run test` and `npx playwright test`
- Tests MUST fail initially (Red phase)

#### 3. **Implement & Iterate** üîÑ

- Write minimal code to make tests pass (Green phase)
- Make frequent, focused commits during development
- Refactor and improve code quality (Refactor phase)
- Continue Red-Green-Refactor cycle until feature complete

#### 4. **Quality Gate - ALL MUST PASS** ‚úÖ

```bash
npm run build        # Zero compilation errors
npm run lint         # Zero linting errors/warnings
npm run test         # All unit tests pass
npx playwright test  # All E2E tests pass
```

**If ANY step fails, fix it. No exceptions.**

#### 5. **Pull Request & Merge** üöÄ

```bash
git push -u origin feature/feature-name
gh pr create --title "Feature description" --body "Detailed description"
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

### üö® CRITICAL RULES

#### Testing Infrastructure

- **If tests are broken, FIX THEM** - never work around broken tests
- **If Playwright fails, DEBUG AND FIX** - don't create simplified testing
- **Test coverage matters** - write comprehensive tests for all scenarios
- **E2E tests are mandatory** - they catch integration issues

#### Quality Standards

- **Zero tolerance for warnings** - fix all linting and TypeScript warnings
- **Build must be clean** - no compilation errors ever
- **Frequent commits** - commit often with meaningful messages
- **No direct main commits** - every change goes through branch ‚Üí PR ‚Üí merge

#### Test-First Mentality

1. **Write the test for what you want to build**
2. **Watch it fail (Red)**
3. **Write minimal code to pass (Green)**
4. **Improve the code (Refactor)**
5. **Repeat until feature complete**

### üîß Development Commands

```bash
# Essential TDD Commands
npm run test         # Run unit tests
npm run test:watch   # Watch mode for TDD cycles
npx playwright test  # E2E tests
npm run build        # Verify compilation
npm run lint         # Check code quality

# Database Operations
npx prisma generate  # After schema changes
npx prisma migrate dev # Apply migrations
```

### üí° Lessons Learned

#### From Character Creation Fix Experience

- **Tests revealed the real issue** - redirect loop due to stale context
- **Linting discipline matters** - clean code prevents future bugs
- **Build verification catches issues early** - don't skip this step
- **E2E tests are valuable** - they catch real user flow problems

#### From Dashboard Refresh Bug Fix

- **Race conditions are subtle** - auth/character context timing during page
  refresh
- **Context state management needs careful sequencing** - don't set completion
  flags prematurely
- **E2E tests catch real user issues** - unit tests wouldn't have found this
  refresh bug
- **Debugging with targeted logging** - add console.log strategically, then
  remove
- **Test isolation is critical** - each test should create its own fresh state

#### From Quest Modal Test Debugging Session

- **Modal state matters for form interactions** - always ensure correct tab/mode
  is active before filling forms
- **Generic text selectors are fragile** - `'text=Cancel'` failed when multiple
  elements contained "Cancel"
- **CSS selector specificity prevents conflicts** -
  `.fixed button:has-text("Cancel")` targets the modal specifically
- **Test suite timeout management** - run individual test suites to identify
  failures faster than waiting for full suite
- **Incremental test fixing is more efficient** - fix one specific test, verify
  it passes, then run full suite
- **Modal component architecture affects testing** - understand component
  structure (tabs, forms, buttons) before writing tests

#### Playwright Testing Best Practices

- **Always run tests headless for CI/automation**:
  `npx playwright test --reporter=line`
- **Use `--reporter=line` for clean output** - avoids spawning report servers
  that hang processes
- **Tests should complete and terminate properly** - no hanging servers blocking
  workflow
- **Use `--headed` only for debugging specific issues** - not for regular test
  runs
- **Create focused tests for specific bugs** - isolate the exact scenario being
  fixed

#### Never Do This Again

- ‚ùå **MAKE ANY CHANGES WHILE ON MAIN BRANCH** - THIS IS THE #1 VIOLATION
- ‚ùå Skip the `git branch` check before starting work
- ‚ùå Treat small changes as "too minor" for branching
- ‚ùå Edit files directly on main "just this once"
- ‚ùå Skip test writing because "tests are broken"
- ‚ùå Accept linting warnings "temporarily"
- ‚ùå Work around test infrastructure issues
- ‚ùå Make changes without comprehensive testing
- ‚ùå Create PRs with failing tests
- ‚ùå Run Playwright tests without proper completion (hanging report servers)
- ‚ùå Assume context loading states work correctly during page refresh
- ‚ùå Use generic text selectors like `'text=Cancel'` when multiple elements
  contain that text
- ‚ùå Forget to switch modal tabs/modes before filling form fields
- ‚ùå Ignore test selector specificity - always target the exact element intended

#### Always Do This

- ‚úÖ **RUN `git branch` BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES** - MANDATORY FIRST STEP
- ‚úÖ **CREATE FEATURE BRANCH IF ON MAIN** - NO EXCEPTIONS
- ‚úÖ Follow the mandatory pre-work checklist every single time
- ‚úÖ Use descriptive branch names with proper prefixes (feature/, bugfix/,
  refactor/)
- ‚úÖ Fix broken test infrastructure immediately
- ‚úÖ Write tests before implementation
- ‚úÖ Maintain zero warnings/errors standard
- ‚úÖ Test all user scenarios end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Commit frequently with clear messages
- ‚úÖ Run Playwright tests with `--reporter=line` for proper process termination
- ‚úÖ Test page refresh scenarios explicitly - they often reveal race conditions
- ‚úÖ Verify context state management during initialization sequences
- ‚úÖ Use specific selectors in E2E tests - avoid generic text selectors that
  match multiple elements
- ‚úÖ Always switch to correct modal tabs/modes before interacting with form
  elements
- ‚úÖ Target modal elements with specific CSS selectors (e.g.,
  `.fixed button:has-text("Cancel")`) to avoid conflicts

### üéØ Success Criteria

Every feature completion must achieve:

- ‚úÖ All tests written before implementation
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (unit + E2E)
- ‚úÖ Zero compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Zero linting warnings
- ‚úÖ Clean build successful
- ‚úÖ PR merged with comprehensive description
- ‚úÖ Feature branch cleaned up

**Remember: The goal is quality software through disciplined TDD practice.**

## E2E Test Output Standards

**üîß Standardized Test Output Specification**

All E2E tests must follow consistent output patterns for improved debugging and
maintenance:

### üìã Required Output Format

**Test Phase Logging:**

- `‚úÖ [Setup] Description` - Test initialization and user creation
- `‚úÖ [Action] Description` - User interactions and form submissions
- `‚úÖ [Verification] Description` - Assertion checks and validation
- `‚ùå [Error] Description` - When operations fail
- `üîç [Debug] Description` - Debugging information when needed

**Screenshot Standards:**

- Naming: `test-{testName}-{phase}.png`
- Phases: `setup`, `action`, `verification`, `error`
- Always use descriptive test names in kebab-case
- Example: `test-character-creation-setup.png`

**Console Output Rules:**

- Always log key test milestones for debugging traceability
- Use structured format: `console.log('‚úÖ [Phase] Specific action completed')`
- Log both success and failure states clearly
- Include relevant data when useful:
  `console.log('‚úÖ [Verification] Modal state:', modalVisible)`

### üö´ Prohibited Patterns

- ‚ùå Inconsistent emoji usage (mixing different status indicators)
- ‚ùå Silent test execution (tests must log key phases)
- ‚ùå Generic screenshot names (`screenshot1.png`, `debug.png`)
- ‚ùå Verbose unnecessary logging (avoid console spam)
- ‚ùå Mixed console.log formats within the same test

### ‚úÖ Required Elements

Every E2E test must include:

1. **Phase logging** for Setup, Action, Verification
2. **Error handling** with `.catch()` for all async operations
3. **Descriptive screenshots** at key phases
4. **Consistent assertion messaging** using expect() with descriptive text
5. **Structured debug output** when tests need to inspect state

### üìù Example Implementation

```typescript
test("standardized test example", async ({ page }) => {
  console.log("‚úÖ [Setup] Starting user registration flow");

  // Setup phase with screenshot
  await page.goto("/");
  await page.screenshot({ path: "test-user-registration-setup.png" });

  console.log("‚úÖ [Action] Filling registration form");
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', testEmail);

  console.log("‚úÖ [Verification] Checking dashboard redirect");
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*\/dashboard/);
  await page.screenshot({ path: "test-user-registration-verification.png" });

  console.log("‚úÖ [Verification] Test completed successfully");
});
```

This specification ensures all E2E tests provide consistent, readable output for
effective debugging and maintenance.

- if the dev server is running and you run a build, you have to restart the dev
  server or it stops working
- I will run the dev server. If you do a build, the dev server will need
  restarted. Don't restart it yourself, ask me to do it.
