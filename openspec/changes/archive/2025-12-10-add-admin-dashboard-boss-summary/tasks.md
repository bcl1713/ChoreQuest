## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Extend family statistics queries to include character gems/honor and boss battle aggregates (weekly/monthly counts, weighted participation per user).

- [x] 1.3 Add a boss battle summary section/card using existing overview styling, showing week/month boss battles and the top participant (weighted participation).
- [x] 1.4 Add tests for the statistics calculations (weighted participation fractions, time windows) and render coverage for the new dashboard elements.
- [x] 1.5 Validate openspec change (`openspec validate add-admin-dashboard-boss-summary --strict`) and adjust per feedback.
